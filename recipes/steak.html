        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <li>Heat 1 tsp oil in a non-stick pan, add the onions, cover the pan and leave to cook for 5 mins. Take off the lid and 
            stir, they should be a little charred now. Stir in the green pepper and garlic, cover the pan and cook for 5 mins more. 
            Put the potatoes in the oven and bake for 15 mins.</li>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <li>While the potatoes are cooking, stir the paprika into the onions and peppers, pour in 150ml water and stir in the cherry 
            tomatoes, tomato pureÃÅe and bouillon. Cover and simmer for 10 mins.</li>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <li>Pan-fry the steak in a hot, non-stick pan for 2-3 mins each side depending on their thickness. Rest for 5 mins. 
            Spoon the goulash sauce onto plates and top with the beef. Serve the chips and spinach alongside.</li>
