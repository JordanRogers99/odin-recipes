<!--This project is being based around my learning with The Odin Project. In this instance, I will create a website with multiple pages and multiple websites. Eventually, I will come back and work on this with CSS and make it look better, but in the meantime I am going to be practicing my HTML chops, getting to grips with uploading to Github regularly, and creating a functioning site. I have already done this in a file on Github that is called HTML-project, but I am following the course to the book and it can't hurt to keep going over this practice point. I am looking forward to seeing how it turns out.>
